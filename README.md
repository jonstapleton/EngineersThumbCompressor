NOTE: This project is not yet complete. Do not, under any circumstances, trust the documents made available here as there is no proof that they actually work.

This project is a full build of the Engineer's Thumb Compression pedal, found at http://valvewizard.co.uk/engineersthumb2.html. The circuit design is copied from this site. The board design, enclosure, and digital control circuit are all added on to the original design.
